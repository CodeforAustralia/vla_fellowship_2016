      <p>Code for Australia is a non-profit organization who works with government to develop tech-based solutions to solve civic-problems. Code for Australia believes that user centered design and agile development processes can help government better drive collaboration and transparency, accelerate economic growth, and reanimate citizenship. We're here to help!</p>

      <p> Free or low-cost legal services are in high demand and are provided by a mix of public, private, and community organizations. Each of these pathways to free legal help varies in service offerings, eligibility criteria, entry points, and referral pathways. Over the next 6 months, our team will be digging into the user experience of receiving referrals and looking for ways to improve client access.

      <a id="our-approach" class="anchor" href="#our-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Approach</h2>
      
      <p>Using data-driven, user-centred, and iterative methods, we will work in short cycles called sprints. Sprints vary in length and outcome, and are defined as we go. We'll be talking with various stakeholders and using common design research methods such as journey mapping, developing personas, and creating case studies to better understand barriers for citizens, as well as legal aid employees.</p>
      <p>We'll be woring in the open--literally, we're sitting at a table on the 16th floor-- and sharing our methods with teams across Legal Aid. Feel free to pop in, say hello and see what we're working on. In addition, you can follow our progress and findings on our <a href="http://cfa-vla.tumblr.com/"><strong>team blog</strong></a> and at monthly open houses at the Code for Australia offices.

      <p> Over the last six months we've been working in an agile and iterative fashion to develop two prototypes for VLA: the <a href="http://bit.ly/vla-reminders">SMS Notification Service</a> and the <a href="http://lac.vla.vic.gov.au">Legal Aid Checker</a>. For the next six months we will be working in 1-4 week sprints cycling through research, prototyping and user testing to develop a working prototype of an online referral and booking system for VLA.</p>
